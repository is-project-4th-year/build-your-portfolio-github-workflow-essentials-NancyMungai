## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course.

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

**1. Concept: Pull Requests**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought the main thing I would learn was how to make pull requests. I assumed the course would mostly be about requesting code reviews and merging branches.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I ended up learning so much more like branching, conflict resolution, commit types, and team workflows. Honestly, it made my whole GitHub experience much more structured and worthwhile.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I now know how to use pull requests to safely merge features. I also learned easier ways to resolve conflicts and understand when and why they occur. It helped me structure my personal portfolio into small issues and milestones and merge confidently.

**2. Concept: Commit Conventions & Team Collaboration.**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I didnâ€™t think much about how I named commits I figured any message would do. I also didnâ€™t realize how important structure was for collaboration.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I learned how proper naming conventions such as feat, fix, chore, etc. make commits readable and meaningful, ensuring clarity especially in group settings. 

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: In my personal portfolio, my commits are now well organized, and even when working alone, I can easily track changes. In a team, this would definitely help others understand what was done and why, and avoid data loss or overlapping edits.

**3. Concept: Branching & Merging**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I assumed branching was only useful for teams working on massive features. I didnâ€™t think it would apply much to an individual project like my portfolio.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out branching is super useful even for small tasks or bug fixes. I even learned about different types of merges like rebase, which I had never heard of before.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: In my personal portforlio I used feature branches for each section, such as About, Hero, Contact, and tested changes in isolation. This gave me more control, helped prevent mistakes, and improved my understanding of code modularity.

**4. Concept: Project Boards**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` :  I thought project boards were something only managers or large teams would use, not something relevant for my own work.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`:
I discovered that GitHub project boards are incredibly helpful. They made it easy to track whatâ€™s done, whatâ€™s in progress, and whatâ€™s still pending. Giving a clear overview of the tasks.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created a project board for my personal portfolio and used it to organize my issues and milestones. It gave me a clear overview of my tasks and helped me keep track of my progress.
## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.
